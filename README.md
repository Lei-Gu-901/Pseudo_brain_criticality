The fullsampling.cpp and subsampling.cpp generate, respectivly, fullsampling of a network of 128 neurons and subsampling of
a network of 8192 neurons. The executable can obtained by
(1) set the parameters in the parameter.h
(2) compile the corresponding file with the makefile

If network structure other than the default ones are needed, set the parameters in parameter.h. Compile the network.cpp
and run the executable to genereate connection data.

The python files are data processing script for generating results of quantities indicated by the file name.
